## Summary

This game was an amazing journey into the world of game development. Prior to this I had not truly grasped the sheer level of engineering and complex maths involved in game design. Using loops, drawing elements onto the canvas, having those elements dynamically react to the player and to the game, incorporating random number generation to spawn the "apple"... It is much to consider, and this is such a simple game! 

All in all, it was fun learning how to further my understanding of manipulating data to achieve an end result! :)
